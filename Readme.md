This is a TI-84 Plus CE program built for simplifying and speeding up the process of finding the area between two lines or the volume of a shape bound by those two lines through various methods.
This is very useful in AP Calculus AB and equivalent classes.

Any and all code suggestions are welcome since I would like to learn more about TI-Basic programming and this code is very much not optimized.

Instructions should be simple enough to follow as they come up in the program, if there are any issues, do not be shy to submit a report but make sure you are doing the equation properly before you request help.



Help requested/to-do

	A better way to do vertical disc and washer volumes

	A view for what type of shape is being used when finding the fomue with a shape

	More shape options

	Cleaning up the code to make more sense and be more efficient
