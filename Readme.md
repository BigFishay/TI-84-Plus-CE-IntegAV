This is a TI-84 Plus CE program built for simplifying and speeding up the process of finding the area between two lines or the volume of a shape bound by those two lines through various methods.
This is very useful in AP Calculus AB and equivalent classes.

Any and all code suggestions are welcome since I would like to learn more about TI-Basic programming and this code is very much not optimized.
